Description: This program accepts an integer from the user and then calls a function to compare the user entered integer to a randomly generated integer. The randomly generated integer is called from another function. The program is to demonstrate how to use a function to call another function. The function that is called inside the first function must be declared before the calling function.

#include <iostream>
#include <ctime> // This library is necessary to generate truly random numbers
using namespace std;

/*
Function: getRandom
Parameters: None
Return: a random integer between 1 and 100, inclusive.
Description: The function generates a random integer between 1 and 100, inclusive, to be used in the next function.
*/
int getRandom() // The order of function declaration is critically important. The innermost function must be declared first, followed by the second innermost, followed by the third, etc.
{
    srand(time(NULL)); // syntax necessary to declare a seeded random number
    int randomnum = rand()%100+1; // mod 100 returns 0-99, but I want 1-100, so I add 1.
    return randomnum; // This function is supposed to return this number to the compare function
}

/*
Function: compare
Parameters: an integer labeled guess
Return: A cout statement
Description: The function declares an integer named randomnum which is initialized by calling the function getRandom. Then the function does a cout statement telling what the random number is. Then an if-elseif-else block is used to compare whether the guess is larger, equal to, or smaller than the randomly generated number. Each if, elseif, and else statement come with a unique cout statement.
*/
void compare(int guess) // This function only has one parameter which is the user guess from main()
{
    int randomnum = getRandom(); // The getRandom function MUST be declared BEFORE the compare function otherwise this will yield a compiler error.
    cout << "Random number: " << randomnum << endl; // Random number is displayed before the if-elseif-else block
    if (guess>randomnum)
    {
        cout << "Your number is larger than the random number." << endl;
    }
    else if (guess == randomnum)
    {
        cout << "Your number is equal to the random number." << endl;
    }
    else
    {
        cout << "Your number is smaller than the random number." << endl;
    }
}
int main()
{
    int guess; // guess is declared in main AND in compare because the scope of both functions is independent of each other.
    cout << "Enter an integer: "; cin >> guess;
    compare(guess); // cout statements are in the compare function, so this is all that is necessary to display results. 
    return 0;
